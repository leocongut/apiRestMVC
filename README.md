# apiRestMVC
a small ApiREst wit MVC to LoremIpsum Ramdom Amount

Step 1:

In the first step I created an asp.net Web Api Project. To this application add a model class and its respective driver. 
In this control I customize the Get so that in the GET verb an IP Lipsum is returned as many times as indicated.

Step 2. I create an MVC project with the default template. 
In the Index of the controller Index we load the instance to call the wepApi. 
At the moment of showing it I modified the central paragraph of the template 
with the content that we are going to obtain from the webApi.
